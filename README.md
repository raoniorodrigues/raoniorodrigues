### About me
I'm a {Quality Assurance and Automation Test Engineer }.

Skills in several programming languages, including Java, Ruby and JavaScript, and management tools such as JIRA, Silk and Azure DevOps, which allow me to perform manual tests with quality and efficiency. In addition, I specialize in agile methodologies such as SCRUM, Kanban and BDD, which allow me to work in a collaborative, iterative and adaptive way.

I have extensive experience in creating and executing functional scripts with Cypress, Rest Assured, Cucumber, Capybara and RSpec for testing web applications, ensuring high quality and performance. In addition, I use the Java language to develop test automation scripts with Selenium, which allows for greater efficiency and test coverage.

To ensure the quality and security of services, I perform service tests (REST) and use tools such as Postman, Git, continuous integration with Jenkins and SoupUI. I am always looking to update myself and improve my skills, aiming to deliver high quality work and customer satisfaction.
